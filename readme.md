# Director

This is a simple solution to bring some camera coverage to your event

## Getting started

- get an api key at <http://peerjs.com/peerserver>
- open <https://firstlegoleague.github.io/director/director.html> on a computer, enter your key, press `connect`
- open <https://firstlegoleague.github.io/director/send.html> on another computer with webcam on the same network, enter your key and a name for the camera and press `connect`

It is a bit clumsy and needs a lot of work still. But it is a start.

## Development

This projects needs a lot of love still. Some things to do:

- more elaborate readme
- get the POC working
- work with peer as a service, removing the need to install it locally
- host everything via github
- styling
- make it work with mhub to control everything
- connect to display system
